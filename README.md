Drupal Grunt Starter
===

Getting started:

1. Node.js and Grunt CLI must be installed. Ensure you can run "npm" and "grunt --help".

1. To install dependencies for the Drupal Grunt script, run "npm install" in the project directory where package.json is located.

1. Update package.json as needed to provide non-standard paths or to enable Compass SASS to CSS compilation for custom themes.

1. Update Gruntfile as needed to add build steps or other project-specific actions.

1. Run "grunt" to execute a full project build or use parameters to execute a specific action (i.e. "grunt compass").
